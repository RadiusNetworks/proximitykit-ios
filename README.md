The Proximity Kit cloud service and mobile SDK from [Radius
Networks](http://www.radiusnetworks.com/) enables developers to add geofence
and proximity beacon capabilities to their iOS mobile application in
minutes.

- Manage and sync beacons to your app.
- No more hardcoding coordinates in your code.
- Implements industry best practices.

## About Proximity Kit for iOS

Designed to help developers build location aware apps. By providing a rich SDK
built on top of the latest geofence and beacon technology, Proximity Kit gives
you the events you need to keep your app relevant and useful to your users.

Upon entering or leaving an beacon or geofence region, Proximity Kit notifies
your app of the proximity event along with region identifiers and associated
metadata. While in an beacon region, Proximity Kit provides additional ranging
services for continuous proximity updates relative to the phone's distance from
the beacon.
